excerpt: '*Received Outstanding Paper Award. In a highly globalized world, it is important for MLLMs to correctly recognize mixed-cultural inputs, where the elements in the input represent multiple cultures. To examine the robustness of MLLMs to mixed cultures, we introduce MixCuBe, a cross-cultural awareness benchmark, and study elements from five countries and four ethnicities.'
