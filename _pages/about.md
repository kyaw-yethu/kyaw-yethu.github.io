I'm Kyaw Ye Thu, a senior undergraduate from the [School of Computing](https://soc.kaist.ac.kr/), [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr/kr/), majoring in computer science and minoring in business and technology management (BTM). I grew up playing PC games and football on streets in Myanmar.

My research interests include but not limited to
1. **Computer Graphics**: _How do we design an efficient rendering pipeline for a game engine? ..._
2.  **Computer Vision**: _How do we enable machines to understand a large video? What applications are possible given access to a lot of videos? ..._
3. **Machine Cognition**: _How do we achieve AGI beyond Transformer-based architectures? How gaming data can be used as training data to instill physics constraints for 3D agents?..._

I'm currently working part-time on Edge Cloud project, developing edge vision model for precision agriculture at Axinvent, a startup affiliated with KAIST, alongside my semester coursework.

Outside of my nerdy interests, I'm a huge fan of football⚽ and story-driven RPGs🎮. Story telling whether through digital media like a video game or through theatrical performance🎭 is an art that deeply captivates me. There're now fewer opportunities for performing arts like I had in high school, but I'd always love to perform activities that somehow engage with an audience.

Before coming to Korea, I volunteered at [Thate Pan Hub](https://thatepanhub.org/), an educational enterprise from Myanmar. I taught introductory computer science to young kids and teenagers acorss Myanmar and helped organize a national hackathon. The best part was I learned how working with a group of passionate people with the same mission can be a very empowering and rewarding experience. So, reach out to me if you want to find ways to work together, whether about a software product, a research topic, a social initiative or maybe a story!
