I'm Kyaw Ye Thu, a Burmese 🇲🇲 boy pursuing educational and personal growth in Korea 🇰🇷 currently as an undergrad student in [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr/kr/). Majoring in computer science and minoring in BTM (business and technology management), I am into the final semester of my Bachelor degree by 2026 Spring.  

Broadly speaking, my main research focuses are computer graphics and computer vision though I'm also fascinated by machine cognition (for AGI) and computer architecture (especially about GPU and TPU). For example,

1. **Computer Graphics**⛰️: _How do we reconstruct a 3D scene obeying physics directly from a sparse set of input images? ..._
2.  **Computer Vision**👁️: _How do we enable machines to understand a large video? What applications are possible given access to a lot of videos? ..._

I've conducted research about evaluating cultural awareness in multi-modal large language model (MLLM) at [U&I Lab](https://uilab.kr/) (KAIST) and developed IoT devices for smart agriculture at [Axinvent](https://www.axinvent.com/). 

Outside my nerdy interests, I can be simultaneously atheletic and nerdy (if I say so myself). I love doing everything related to football⚽ and playing story-driven RPGs🎮. Story telling whether through a video, a game or a theatrical performance🎭 is an art that deeply captivates me. I always wanted to be involved, as a director or an actor, in some sort of narrative projects that tell powerful stories. 

Reach out to me if you want to find ways to work with me together, whether about a software product, a research topic, a social initiative or maybe a story!
