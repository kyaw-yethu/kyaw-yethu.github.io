I'm Kyaw Ye Thu, a senior undergraduate from the [School of Computing](https://soc.kaist.ac.kr/), [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr/kr/), majoring in computer science and minoring in business and technology management (BTM). I grew up playing PC games and football on streets in Myanmar.

My main expertise in computer science revolves around AI, while computer systems and computer graphics also fascinate me greatly. For examples, systems for AI and efficient rendering engines for games are problems of great interests to me. In short, I'm interested in tackling intelligence and graphics-related problems from the persepctives of both hardware and algorithms.

I'm a huge fan of footballâš½ and story-driven RPGsðŸŽ®. Story telling whether through digital media like a video game or through theatrical performanceðŸŽ­ is an art that deeply captivates me. There're now fewer opportunities for performing arts like I had in high school, but I'd always love to perform activities that somehow engage with an audience.

Before coming to Korea, I volunteered at [Thate Pan Hub](https://thatepanhub.org/), an educational enterprise from Myanmar. I taught introductory computer science to young kids and teenagers acorss Myanmar and helped organize a national hackathon. The best part was I learned how working with a group of passionate people with the same mission can be a very empowering and rewarding experience. So, reach out to me if you want to find ways to work together, whether about a software product, a research topic, a social initiative or maybe a story!
