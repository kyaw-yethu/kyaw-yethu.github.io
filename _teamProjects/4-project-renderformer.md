title: "RenderFormer with Linear Attention"
collection: projects
permalink:
excerpt: "Renderformer is an end-to-end fully data-driven transformer-based rendering pipeline developed by Microsoft. Due to its usage of vinalla transformer architecture, it has time complexity O(N^2). We tried to achieve linear time complexity by using a linear attention mechanism, namely Performer (FAVOR++).  "
